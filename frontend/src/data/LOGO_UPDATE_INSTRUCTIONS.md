/* IMPORTANT: Replace the logo URL in HomePage.js */

To use your actual AMP logo:

1. Save your logo image as "amp-logo.png" in the /app/frontend/public/ folder

2. In HomePage.js, replace the current logo src with:
   src="/amp-logo.png"

3. The logo appears in two places:
   - Navigation bar (around line 109)
   - Footer (around line 637)

Replace both instances of the logo src attribute with "/amp-logo.png"

Your logo should be optimized to around 200-300px wide for best results.
